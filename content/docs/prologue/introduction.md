**Getting Started**

HackBio is a virtual 5 weeks internship. The internship has been divided into stages and each participant has to complete their task to upgrade into the next stage. Each week different tasks will be assigned to the participants and it is mandatory to complete the task to reach the next level otherwise the participant will be eliminated. The elimination is a continuous process and the organisers will be eliminating the participants based on their performance. Slack will be used as a communication portal.

Before the task:

- Join slack platform and add yourself to different channels ([#hackbio-office](https://hackbiointernship2021.slack.com/archives/C025888LNSV), [#hello-world](https://hackbiointernship2021.slack.com/archives/C029E5WJDH8), [#random](https://hackbiointernship2021.slack.com/archives/C025KDN2CDN), [#resources](https://hackbiointernship2021.slack.com/archives/C029EDBCE31), [#talent-market](https://hackbiointernship2021.slack.com/archives/C029DK62QUX), [#help-](https://hackbiointernship2021.slack.com/archives/C029AU7ME82))
- Browse/ find yourself a team (channel browser, [#talent-market](https://hackbiointernship2021.slack.com/archives/C029DK62QUX), [#help-](https://hackbiointernship2021.slack.com/archives/C029AU7ME82))
- Collaborate with the team member for the task

[The Spreadsheet project](https://hackbiointernship2021.slack.com/archives/C025888LNSV/p1627841351303100)

- Each team should create a GitHub repo.
- Add a comprehensive readme.md with essential information about the internship, the team, the contributors, pictures if possible using markdown.
- Each team will work on a minimum of 7 different programming languages
- For each person in a team, pick one of the 7 programming languages. Write a script that prints your name, your email, your slack username (with @) , your biostack, your twitter handle and hamming distance in that order. The output for every team member should now be ```name```, ```email```, ```slack_username``` (with @) your ```biostack``` , ```twitter_handle``` and ```hamming_distance``` .
- Push the script to your team&#39;s git repo
- Collaboratively as a team, develop a bash script that clones the git repo, and generates a CSV file from all the outputs of your team&#39;s scripts
- Submit your team&#39;s _GitHub link to only_ the bash script
- Only the emails and slack handles that are on the CSV sheet generated by your script will be promoted to stage 1
