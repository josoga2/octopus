### _Michael is now helping NIMR to discover clinically relevant variants in the _Plasmodium_ **genome.**_


**Who is Michael Olufemi?**

**Michael** is a graduate of Zoology (Parasitology option) at the University of Lagos and currently, I work as a Research Assistant at the Nigeria Institute of Medical Research (NIMR). I have always wanted to do bioinformatics since 2019 during my final year after taking a theoretical course in bioinformatics.

**Before HackBio**

Prior to HackBio, I read a lot of materials on how to get started in bioinformatics. I was overloaded with so much information that the only thing I could get from it was &quot;learn programming&quot; and with no direction, I started learning the wrong languages in web development (HTML, CSS &amp; JavaScript).

I just had this feeling I was learning the wrong thing then I stumbled on a more useful resource on the internet a video with more steps, so I decided to retrace my steps and left web development and started learning python and with more useful videos online and no direction, I just kept learning in faith, I didn&#39;t really see the applicability then but I just dedicated my time and hoped it will be someday useful.

I was still learning python when one of my good friends today - funny how we connected on LinkedIn and became friends - she was the one that told me about HackBio. We had similar stories and she had registered before me for the same cohort. She believed it would be vital for our skills set in bioinformatics and encouraged me to register which I did and the decision that I am grateful for today.



_**HackBio was my jumpstart in acquiring bioinformatics skills and they gave me a clear sense of direction. I learned a lot of skills during my stay with HackBio which has helped me in learning other skills on my own.**_
 
**After HackBio**

HackBio was really rigorous and very challenging for me during the classroom phase as I wasn&#39;t familiar with the command-line and the Unix/Linux operating system. I had a lot of challenges with comprehending the Genomics classes which was my specialization and coupled with the fact that I had a bad laptop, no electricity and slow internet and I was still Sokoto where I was serving. But thanks to the **recorded classes** when I got back to Lagos I was able to cover up.

HackBio was my jumpstart in acquiring bioinformatics skills and they gave me a clear sense of direction. I learnt both foundational and advanced bioinformatics skills during my stay with HackBio. Skills ranging from full genome assembly to variant calling, eQTL mapping, and phylogenomics. These skills have helped me in learning other skills on my own.

With bioinformatics, it is just getting started with the foundations there&#39;s so much to learn and so many packages and programs to be used. The skills I gained at HackBio have made me understand my work at NIMR more clearly and given me relevance and an obvious edge at work.

Yeah, I would recommend someone, especially fresh graduates from life sciences to learn bioinformatics with HackBio. It will really help you integrate into modern science, healthcare and give you a special kind of relevance at work or school; the kind I enjoy now!

**Thank you**  **HACKBIO**
