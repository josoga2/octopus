# Week One on the HackBio Internship üòç

[I](https://www.linkedin.com/in/suchitra-thapa-a722444/) applied for [HackBio 2021 internship](https://thehackbio.com/internship) with an aim to learn computational data analysis skills for my future researches and luckily got selected. I joined it with an open mind to learn bioinformatics. This is my first week and I can already feel the pressure to learn more. Most interesting is the task based and self-paced learning opportunity. This self-paced learning has provided freedom to me while task will teach me the time management and programming skills simultaneously. Also, the arrangement of working in teams has exposed me to wider range of people with different discipline and skillset. This week has been a great learning and sharing experience. The organizer has made sure that the communication within participants and organizers remain continuous and smooth using slack platform. Additionally, the in-between tasks and entertaining dialogues from organizers has kept me on the hook and active. With each passing days, I believe I will grow as the task will get tougher. I am confident that this internship will be the most valuable learning experience of my life and ultimately me, along with my team member will be able to contribute to scientific community in the long run.

Happy learning. Cheers!
